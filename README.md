It's a web portal for budding entrepreneurs, early stage startups and SMEs. Our motive is to let startups build a network and grow together. Entrepreneurs can add a query for other startups to help him and also do the same for the others. They can checkout latest startup events and attend them according to their needs. They can contact us for their different needs and we can get back to them.

It's a python based project so make sure that you have it installed in your system. Create basic tables in your mysql, database used is teksystems and various tables are users (name,email,username,password), userqueries(username, query) , usercontacts (name, email, subject, message) To Run this on your system you just have to install the requirements.txt file as all the requirements are listed in that file.
